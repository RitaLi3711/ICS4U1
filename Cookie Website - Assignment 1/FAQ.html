        <h3>How do you make gooey chocolate chip cookies? </h3>
        <p>The trick to making this best chocolate chip cookie recipe gooey is to not over-bake them.</p>

        <h3>Why do cookies spread & flatten?</h3>
        <p>There are a few main reasons for this that I have found in my experience:</p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Expired leavening agents. If your baking soda or baking powder are past their prime, your chocolate chip
                cookies will likely flatten and spread. Even if the date on the container checks out, it still might not
                be good. That would be the first place I would start.
            </li>
            <p>How to test if your baking soda is active: Combine 1/2 cup of hot water, 1/4 teaspoon vinegar and 1/4
                tsp of baking soda. When you add the baking soda a reaction should take place immediately. If not, then
                you need new baking soda.</p>
            <p>How to test if your baking powder is active: Add 1/2 tsp of baking powder to 1/2 cup of hot water. It
                should bubble immediately. A reaction should take place immediately. If not, then you need new baking
                powder.</p>
            <li>Over-mixing. If you over-mix the ingredients in this best chocolate chip cookie recipe you may end up
                with flat cookies.</li>
            <li>Ingredients are too warm. Sometimes over-mixing can also lead to your ingredients becoming too warm. If
                you notice this happening, you can chill the dough before baking to return the batter to room
                temperature.</li>
            <li>Incorrect oven temperature. I recommend baking with an electric convection oven. If your cookies and
                other baked goods are not turning out properly, invest in a cheap oven thermometer to check the
                temperature. If your oven is baking too hot or too cold, then the cookies will not turn out well.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Why didn’t my cookies flatten?</h3>
        <p>If your cookies didn’t flatten, here are a few things that could’ve been the problem:</p>

        <ol type="1">
            <li>The ingredients/cookie dough was too cold. Cold dough doesn’t spread as well as room temperature dough.
            </li>
            <li>You accidentally used too much flour. Be sure to use a measuring cup made for dry ingredients (not a
                pyrex liquid measuring cup), and measure the flour correctly by scooping and leveling.
            <li>

                pyrex liquid measuring cup), and measure the flour correctly by scooping and leveling.</li>
            <li> The butter/sugar mixture wasn’t fully creamed. Try creaming the butter and sugar together for longer.
            </li>

            <h3>Can you bake chocolate chip cookie dough from frozen?</h3>
            <p>I have tested baking this recipe from frozen more times than I can even count. I have gotten the best
                results when I place the dough on a parchment lined baking sheet.
                Then, preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (ONLY if you are baking the frozen dough) and put the
                cookies in the oven in the beginning of the preheating time. Set the timer for 15 minutes and remove the
                cookies after 15 minutes. The top will look a little more brown than usual, but they will still taste
                amazing.</p>

            <h3>Can I halve this recipe?</h3>
            <p>Yes, this recipe halves easily. Simply decrease the ingredients by half and the recipe will make 18
                cookies.</p>

            <h3>Can I add nuts to this recipe?</h3>
            <p>Yes, you can add walnuts or pecans with great success. Simply decrease the amount of chocolate chips
                slightly to accommodate the extra nuts.</p>

            <h3>Can I substitute ingredients?</h3>
            <p>The only ingredient I feel confident that can be changed up is the mix-ins. Chocolate chips, sprinkles,
                peanut butter chips, etc. Do not change anything else in this recipe. If you do I cannot guarantee they
                will turn out. However, here are some tested substitutions.</p>

            <ol type="1">
                <li>Butter. I use salted butter, but unsalted butter would also be great. I just recommend tasting the
                    dough to ensure that it’s salted to your liking.</li>
                <li>White Sugar. You can use granulated white sugar or organic cane sugar.</li>
                <li>Sea Salt. I exclusively bake and cook with pure, fine sea salt. Sea salt is different than table
                    salt (that is iodized), so if you use salt other than sea salt I recommend testing the recipe first
                    with 1/2 tsp and then adjusting to your taste.</li>
                <li>Chocolate Chips. As you can see from the photos, sometimes I use chocolate chunks, chopped
                    chocolate, or chocolate chips. It doesn’t matter what you use, as long as you use 2 cups.</li>
            </ol>
