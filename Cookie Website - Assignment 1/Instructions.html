        <h2>Make the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough</h2>
        <p>The first step in making these easy chocolate chip cookies to to combine the dry ingredients in a medium size
            bowl.

            When doing this, make sure to Measure the flour correctly. Be sure to use a measuring cup made for dry
            ingredients (NOT a pyrex liquid measuring cup). Then, measure flour by scooping it into a measuring cup and
            leveling it with a knife.</p>

        <p>Next, cream together butter and sugars, make sure to soften the butter early by taking it out of the fridge
            at least two hours before baking so it’s ready to go when you need it. You can also warm it in the microwave
            for about 7 seconds, but be very careful not to melt it.

            Once butter/sugar mixture is beaten well, add the eggs & vanilla and beat to combine.</p>

        <p>Add dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Then add the chocolate chips and beat until they are evenly
            distributed throughout the dough.

            Use LOTS of chocolate chips. You want at least two gooey chocolate chips in every bite.</p>

        <p>The chocolate chip cookie dough should be easy to roll and not sticky. It should not be dry or crumbly. See
            photo below for the optimal texture.</p>

        <h2>Portion & Roll Dough</h2>
        <p>Once the cookie dough is finished, it’s time to portion and roll the dough. I know many people eyeball it
            when making cookies, however I highly recommend using a cookie scoop.

            Using a cooking scoop ensures that all the cookies are uniform in size so that they bake evenly. I love this
            stainless steel cookie scoop and use it every time I make cookies.

            At this point you can either bake your dough or freeze it.</p>

        <h2>How To Freeze Cookie Dough:</h2>
        <p>Since this chocolate chip cookie recipe makes so many cookies, I always make a full batch and freeze some.
            That way I have dough on hand for unexpected guests or whenever the cookie craving strikes.

            I prefer to flash-freeze the cookie dough before putting it in an airtight container. To do this, roll the
            cookie dough into balls and space them out on a parchment lined baking sheet. Then put the baking sheet in
            the freezer for about 30 minutes, or until the dough slightly freezes.

            Once the dough is slightly frozen, transfer the cookie dough balls to an airtight container or plastic bag
            and freeze for up to 2 months.

        <h2>How to Bake Frozen Dough</h2>
        <p>There are two ways to bake frozen dough:</p>

        <ol type="1">
            <li>Thaw it first: I love having dough ready to go in the freezer for impromptu guests. When you want to
                bake them, remove the dough balls from the freezer, set them on a parchment-lined baking sheet and cover
                with a light cloth towel or napkin to let them thaw. Then, once they reach room temperature (after about
                1-2 hours depending on the temperature of your kitchen) bake as directed in the recipe (at 375 degrees
                F). SO easy!</li>
            <li>Bake from frozen: Place the dough on a parchment lined baking sheet. Then, preheat the oven to 350
                degrees Fahrenheit (ONLY if you are baking the frozen dough) and put the cookies in the oven in the
                beginning of the preheating time. (So put the cookies in the oven as you preheat it). Set the timer for
                15 minutes and remove the cookies after 15 minutes. The top will look a little more brown than usual,
                but they will still taste amazing.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Bake Until they just barely look done</h2>
        <p>If you are baking the cookies immediately simply roll them into balls, place them evenly apart on a baking
            sheet (about 1.5 to 2 inches apart) and bake at 375 degrees for 8-10 minutes.

            The most important piece of advice I can give you is – DO NOT over-bake these chocolate chip cookies! They
            will not look done when you pull them out of the oven, and that is GOOD.

            At the end of the baking time, these chocolate chip cookies won’t look done but they are. They will look a
            little doughy when you remove them from the oven, and thats good. They may be lightly browned in a few
            places, which is exactly how you want them.

            They will set up as they sit on the cookie sheet for a few minutes. I never bake them for more than 9
            minutes</p>

        <h2>Cool</h2>
        <p>Cool the chocolate chip cookies on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool
            completely (or just eat them warm while the chocolate chips are melty)!</p>

        <h2>Store</h2>
        <p>Store these chocolate chip cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days, or in the
            freezer for up to 2 months.</p>
